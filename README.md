Developed a Python Project which uses NLP to classify patients' health conditions based on reviews. The
focus is on Birth Control,Depression,Diabetes Type 2, High Blood Pressure and Smoking Cessation. After data
preprocessing, a Passive Aggressive Classifier is chosen for its higher accuracy compared to Naive Bayes.
Evaluation includes a Confusion Matrix, highlighting the model's accuracy in categorizing patients' conditions.
